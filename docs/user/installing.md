# Installing CustomKnight

You can acquire a Custom Knight release either by using [this lumafly magic link](https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/commands/download/?mods=Custom%20Knight) or by downloading a zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/HollowKnight.CustomKnight/releases) and installing manually by following these instructions.

> Note : if manually installing you must install [Satchel](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/Satchel) yourself

1. Extract the .zip file.
2. Place the output folder under the Mods/CustomKnight directory:
Typical installation directory for your OS :

#### Windows	
> `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\CustomKnight\`
#### Mac
> `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.app/hollow_knight_Data/Resources/Data/Managed/Mods/CustomKnight/`
#### Linux
> `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/Mods/CustomKnight/`

3. Open the game and load a save. (may take a while on first run as the mod is extracting the default skin) 
4. Pause the game and Use the menu on the right to select a skin.

> Note : You can always go to Settings > Mods > CustomKnight & choose your desired skin / settings.
