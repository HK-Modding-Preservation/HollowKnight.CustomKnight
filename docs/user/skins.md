## Skins

### Installing Skins:

> TODO: Add a screenshot here

Follow the instructions below to install a skin, or you can watch [this video tutorial by fireb0rn](https://youtu.be/z35cFvU0McQ?si=Nqurex-9Kg0I_foo&t=466)

1. Download the skin 
2. Place the skin's images in a directory that is the same name as the skin
3. Copy this directory to the Skins directory under the game's Mods/CustomKnight directoy (mentioned earlier)

Make sure that the folder you copy opens directly to the image files themselves. That is, when you double click on the folder, it opens up to the PNGs themselves and not to another folder or zip. 

### Where to find skins:

You can find most skins on [ColetteMSLP's Comprehensive Skin List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKfOtOXpYormusD05I700P8d79E74R1bTb3MP4vum-E/edit#heading=h.p6xizipivwq8) if there is a skin you can't find on there then you can ask on [The Hollow Knight Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/RppAb2vNqz).
