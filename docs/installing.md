# Installing CustomKnight

You can acquire a Custom Knight release either by using [this lumafly magic link](https://themulhima.github.io/Lumafly/commands/download/?mods=Custom%20Knight) or by downloading a zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/HollowKnight.CustomKnight/releases) and installing manually by following these instructions.

> Note : if manually installing you must install [Satchel](https://github.com/PrashantMohta/Satchel) yourself

1. Extract the .zip file.
2. Place the output folder under the Mods/CustomKnight directory:

```
Typical installation directories :

Linux		~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/Mods/CustomKnight/
