#### CustomKnight API

- Adds ability to add more items that can be skinned (even custom items)
- Adds ability to extend or modify existing skins at runtime (Including Swapper) 
- Adds ability to provide a skin directly at runtime ( allows taking control of the skin without breaking compatibility)
- Adds ability to set the current skin

See example mods under `AddonExample` directory in this repo for more, xml docs are added as they felt needed.
