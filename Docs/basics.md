## Basic Skins

1. Edit the existing skin images in your photo editing software of choice.
2. Save each skin under the exact same name as the PNG file that it is overriding in the Defaults folder, e.g. if you 
   are creating a skin for Grimmchild, save the image as "Grimm.png".
3. Put the edited images in a folder with the name that you want your custom skin to have.
4. To use your custom skin, follow steps 2 - 3 in the "Installing Skins" section.

Note that, You do not need to have all the images that Default has in your folder, just the ones you edit will suffice.
