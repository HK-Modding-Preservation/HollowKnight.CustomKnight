# CustomKnight 
A Hollow Knight mod to load custom texture sheets for the player

### Installing the Mod Manually:

1. Extract the .zip file.
2. Place the output folder under the Mods directory:

``` 
Windows		C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\
Mac		~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight.app/hollow_knight_Data/Resources/Data/Managed/Mods/
Linux		~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Hollow Knight/hollow_knight_Data/Managed/Mods/
```

3. Open the game (may take a while) and load a save.
4. Pause the game and choose your desired skin from the scrollable menu to the left.

### Customising the mod:

- In the spirit of customisation, the mod let's you customise itself using `CustomKnight.GlobalSettings.json` present in your Saves directory.

### Installing Skins:

1. Download the skin 
2. Place the skin's images in a directory that is the same name as the skin
3. Copy this directory to the CustomKnight directory under the game's Mods directoy (mentioned earlier)

Make sure that the folder you copy opens directly to the image files themselves. That is, when you double click on the folder, it opens up to the PNGs themselves and not to another folder or zip. 

### Creating your own skins:

1. Edit the existing skin images in your photo editing software of choice.
2. Save each skin under the exact same name as the PNG file that it is overriding in the Defaults folder, e.g. if you 
   are creating a skin for Grimmchild, save the image as "Grimm.png".
3. Put the edited images in a folder with the name that you want your custom skin to have.
4. To use your custom skin, follow steps 2 - 3 in the "Installing Skins" section.

Note that, You do not need to have all the images that Default has in your folder, just the ones you edit will suffice.
